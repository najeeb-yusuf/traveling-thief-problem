## Language discussion: Decided to use Python 

## Designing fitness functions and algorithms for a problem.

• Discuss two questions related to the Traveling Thief Problem, including finding the solution and satisfying requirements in different cities.

• Discuss designing a fitness function and algorithm for a problem, with some disagreement on the approach.

## Using Pythagorean theorem for distance calculation in TSP. 

• Explains how to calculate distances between cities using the Pythagorean Theorem.

## Solving complex optimization problems using Al. 

• Propose linking two problems (TSP and NP) to find a solution like using Ant Colony Optimisation(ACO) and pheromones to optimize item placement in a city.
• Suggest conducting research and documenting it before starting work on the fitness function.

• Research algorithms for a machine learning problem.

• Look at algorithms before deciding on a approach.

• Discuss strategies for handling infeasible solutions in a simulated annealing algorithm.

• Discuss how to approach research and representation of data to solve a problem.

## Research and report writing for algorithms.

• Discuss dividing research tasks among team members, with one suggesting focusing on  two people to do the research and document it extensively.
• Split into subgroups to tackle different aspects of algorithm development.

## Data for traveling salesman and knapsack problems. 

• Explain how to parse data for traveling salesman problem and knapsack problem.

## Fitness function for optimization algorithm. 

• Use  hyper parameters to balance time and weight in fitness function.
• Discuss the need for a physical meeting to brainstorm and develop a new algorithm for a fitness function.
Data structures and code writing. 

## Scheduling and assignments in a meeting. 

Work distribution (tentative) 

1. Research ant optimisation algorithms that can be used to solve the problem, highlighting pros and cons for each one. Special focus on the nature of the problem whereby two different types of problems intertwine

- RAHATAL, Ritesh Sunil

 

2. Write the function that parses the data into the program, special focus on what data structures to use to represent both the traveling salesman part of the problem and the knapsack problem. A data structure that makes it easy to change which location is visited or what items are picked is preferred

3. Write the fitness function that takes in the locations visited, the knapsack at each location and returns the final weight of the bag and the total time taken to finish the tour. Special focus will be on maximising the speed of this function, since it will be executed several times

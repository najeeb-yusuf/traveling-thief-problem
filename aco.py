    '''

    Parameters
    ------------
    points: list
        list of cities

    n_ants: int
        Number of ants included in colony

    n_iterations: int
        Number of iterations to run

    alpha: float
        weight on pheromones - higher emphasizes importance of pheromones
       
    beta: float
        weight on heuristic (distance, cost) - higher increase reliance of this info on ant decision making
        

    evaperation rate: float
        rate of pheromone evaporation

    Q: Float
        Amount of pheromone deposited - higher the Q, more substantial increase in pheromone levels on nodes visited

    cities_stolen: Dict
        Dictionary showing which items were stolen at each city

    Returns
